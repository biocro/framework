## Note: The rules here are mainly rules that should apply to particular file
## names at all levels (e.g. .DS_Store, *.swp). Many of the other "ignore" rules
## have been moved to .gitignore files in the subdirectories they most directly
## pertain to.  One advantage of this is that if those directories should happen
## to be renamed, the rules pertaining to them need not be revised.
